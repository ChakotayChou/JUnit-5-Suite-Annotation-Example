# JUnit-5-Suite-Annotation-Example
This is probably the first working example for using JUnit 5 Suite annotation to create Test Suite in the internet. 
順道抱怨一下，TMD問個問題在堆疊溢位都要小心，一堆自以為是的假大神，媽的蕾，草

This example uses Maven Surefire to make @Suite work. I don't know if this is the only way for now, but at least it works.

I got this solution from ***JUnit Collaborator sormuras*** in https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/discussions/2753
